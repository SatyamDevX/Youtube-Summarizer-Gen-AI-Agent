[21.55 --> 23.32] You're about to hold a plank.
[23.62 --> 25.22] Just 60 seconds.
[25.22 --> 26.79] You know it’s coming.
[27.02 --> 28.79] That tension in your core.
[28.79 --> 30.33] The burn in your arms.
[30.53 --> 32.40] The mental countdown ticking away.
[32.80 --> 34.23] You’re already thinking,
[38.97 --> 41.44] Now imagine you push through that feeling.
[41.67 --> 42.71] You hold on. 
[42.71 --> 44.51] Maybe your body starts shaking.
[44.54 --> 47.01] Your mind is screaming for you to stop.
[47.24 --> 50.35] You tell yourself just one more second, 
[50.71 --> 52.25] and you make it to 60.
[52.95 --> 55.19] You’re feeling pretty proud of yourself.
[56.89 --> 59.29] (Cheers and applause)
[63.63 --> 66.93] But then you don’t stop at 60 seconds.
[66.93 --> 68.47] You don't stop at five minutes.
[68.47 --> 70.83] You keep going for an hour,
[71.27 --> 76.14] for two hours and then ten hours.
[76.81 --> 81.28] Yep, ten hours, ten minutes, 
and ten seconds.
[81.75 --> 84.35] That's exactly what George Hood did
[84.35 --> 88.99] when he set the world record
for the longest plank in history,
[90.39 --> 93.32] a feat that most people
would not believe possible.
[94.99 --> 98.93] I met George eight years ago
when he set the record,
[98.93 --> 100.73] at that time, five hours.
[100.73 --> 102.20] And I’ll tell you this,
[102.60 --> 107.17] he just looked like the definition
of mental toughness.
[107.67 --> 112.84] The focus in his eyes was razor sharp
 and he was drenched in sweat.
[113.04 --> 114.68] He was hurting.
[114.68 --> 116.31] You could see it in his face.
[116.75 --> 120.78] Feel it in his body, but he didn’t stop.
[121.98 --> 125.72] Later I asked him,
George, how do you do it?
[126.59 --> 128.56] His answer surprised me.
[128.76 --> 131.19] The plank is 90% mental.
[131.79 --> 134.50] George told me 
he kept his mind busy
[134.93 --> 139.07] distracting himself by focusing on 
the conversations in the room,
[139.54 --> 142.14] drawing energy 
from the people around him.
[142.77 --> 145.71] But there was something
deeper happening here.
[146.61 --> 150.05] We often think of grit
as that mental toughness
[150.05 --> 153.38] that helps people achieve
extraordinary things,
[153.38 --> 156.92] like ultramarathoners finishing
races with broken bones.
[157.49 --> 159.06] But here's the twist.
[159.46 --> 162.16] Grit isn't just about willpower.
[162.63 --> 169.60] It’s rooted in biology, and the most
powerful indicator to date is a protein
[169.97 --> 172.07]  that we’re just starting to understand,
[172.47 --> 177.31] called Brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.
[178.61 --> 182.58] Think of BDNF as
fertilizer for your brain.
[183.31 --> 186.65] A protein that helps neurons, 
the cells in your brain,
[186.88 --> 191.39] grow, stay healthy, and 
communicate more effectively.
[191.79 --> 197.53] This protein is crucial for things
like memory and mental resilience.
[198.13 --> 200.53] Many things increase BDNF, 
[200.53 --> 205.03] including sunshine, blueberries,
and antidepressants.
[206.00 --> 209.21] Exercise increases BDNF the most.
[210.11 --> 213.48] And the plank?
Yes, that simple yoga pose,
[214.21 --> 217.61] just might be one of the best exercises
[217.61 --> 220.15] for building mental toughness.
[220.98 --> 223.59] I’m a clinical professor and diplomat
[223.59 --> 226.62] in the Department of
Preventive Medicine at UCSD. 
[227.42 --> 231.33] I’ve been doing clinical research
for over 40 years.
[232.46 --> 235.56] In the clinic, 
many of the patients I care for
[235.56 --> 238.63]  are so-called medically destitute.
[239.27 --> 242.41] Some had a heart attack
or stroke in their 40s.
[243.17 --> 246.64] Some experienced 
a horrific accident in their 20s,
[247.11 --> 249.48] rendering them unemployable,
[249.48 --> 253.42] stripping them of everything
 and leaving them with chronic pain
[253.42 --> 257.32] or disability and 
a heavy dose of despair.
[258.62 --> 264.83] In no way am I suggesting something as
basic as a plank can fix these conditions.
[265.63 --> 271.00] But more research is warranted
to learn the potential benefits.
[272.64 --> 276.54] What makes the concept of grit
 and BDNF so compelling to me
[276.91 --> 282.71] are real life examples of individuals 
enduring these devastating conditions.
[283.68 --> 288.62] Researchers and clinicians still have a
lot of questions about grit and the plank.
[289.35 --> 293.32] No one has ever studied
BDNF during a plank.
[293.79 --> 297.66] Yet, what we know is this: 
[297.66 --> 301.76] the most effective exercises
for raising BDNF levels 
[301.76 --> 304.97] are those requiring mental effort.
[305.24 --> 310.27] If you've ever done a plank, you know
how quickly mental fortitude is required.
[310.97 --> 313.94] That, along with what
we've learned from George,
[313.94 --> 318.08] leads us to believe the plank
may be one of the most efficient
[318.42 --> 322.25] and effective ways of increasing BDNF.
[323.15 --> 327.12] You see, grit is not just for planks.
[327.79 --> 331.13] And BDNF is not just a theory,
[331.43 --> 333.63] it’s backed by science.
[334.63 --> 340.14] A 2005 article in the aptly 
named journal Hippocampus
[340.14 --> 345.08] described an animal study
in which exhausting physical exercises
[345.07 --> 348.68] like continuous swimming
 produce less BDNF
[349.05 --> 354.05] than exercise that required
 mental focus, like navigating mazes.
[355.05 --> 359.46] In people, activities 
such as yoga, of all things
[360.39 --> 364.33] that combine physical effort 
and concentration,
[364.96 --> 370.07] have produced some of the highest levels
of BDNF ever measured.
[371.53 --> 375.70] Currently, I’m designing 
a study for people like Daniel
[376.27 --> 379.21] to see if the plank relieves pain.
[379.71 --> 382.61] Daniel suffers from 
a very rare condition
[383.15 --> 389.85] known as Complex regional
pain syndrome, or CRPS,
[390.49 --> 394.96] which is infamous as
one of the most painful diseases.
[395.79 --> 397.59] There is no known cure.
[398.39 --> 403.00] As one patient said,
the slight sensation of water dripping
[403.00 --> 405.97] on my foot feels like hot lead.
[407.17 --> 410.37] Despite living with 
this excruciating pain,
[411.14 --> 416.21] Daniel managed to do 
a plank for over nine hours
[417.75 --> 420.22]  on his CRPS arm.
[420.92 --> 422.52] Think about that for a minute.
[423.75 --> 428.89] The most physically and mentally
challenging exercises helped
[429.46 --> 431.80] one of the most painful conditions.
[433.06 --> 439.97] Now we have evidence that an important 
part of the answer lies in BDNF.
[441.00 --> 445.04] In August of 2024, an article appeared
[445.04 --> 448.44] in Experimental Neurobiology titled
[448.64 --> 452.95] “Modulation of BDNF 
by Physical Exercise.”
[453.65 --> 458.59] They found exercise
doubled the level of BDNF.
[461.09 --> 463.86] I am here to raise awareness 
[464.33 --> 467.93] so that this relationship 
between exercise, BDNF
[468.30 --> 472.44] and improving the quality of life 
may be studied further.
[473.34 --> 476.74] BDNF is hot in the research world.
[477.14 --> 479.14] I'm about to make it hotter.
[479.51 --> 482.11] (Cheers and applause)
[486.32 --> 491.12] George, Daniel and 
my patients deserve as much.
[491.99 --> 495.46] Now I'm going to leave you
with the challenge.
[495.66 --> 500.20] The next time you feel you need
 more grit in your life, do a plank.
[500.96 --> 504.17] If you can't get on the floor,
do it against a wall.
[504.53 --> 508.47] It only takes a minute, 
but that minute can be transformative.
[509.24 --> 511.94] Thank you. (Applause)
